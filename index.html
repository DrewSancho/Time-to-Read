        <p class="para">In today's rapidly moving society, even the biggest bibliophiles sometimes have problems finding the time to sit down with a good book. But if you are creative and observant, you'll begin to see how parts of your everyday routine can be used as reading Opportunitiess.
        Buy an audio version of a book. It's usually the cheapest option, and readily available, so you can listen to it just about anywhere. Many public libraries now allow their cardholders to download electronic audiobooks to personal MP3 players. Alternatively, you can buy audio books on CDs or specialized MP3 players. You could also buy the audio version of a book you already own.</p>
        <p class="para">Carry your reading material with you wherever you go. That way, you will have it with you when you have a few moments of reading that you can slip in. Buy a pocket version of a book, such as the Barnes and Noble Pocket Classics. These are cheap, small and can fit in your purse or back pocket. Read or listen while you are waiting or on line for something. Read or listen on your lunch break at work, or even during breakfast. If you are a college student, read a book between classes instead of the school newspaper. Pick books for ease of reading and/or interest level. Even if you do enjoy involved reading during quiet times at home, a crowded airport might not be conducive to the level of focus required to absorb it.</p>
        Read while working out at the gym. The elliptical trainer, arc trainer and stationary bike all accommodate book reading, and some gyms have book holders to hold reading material for those who want to read during their workout. Then you will get smarter and fitter simultaneously, and your workout will become more enjoyable at the same time.
        Ask your family members to do more housework so that you may relax for a half hour each day to read.
        <p class="para">Consider a book or audio book with you when you're on a trip or vacation. Books and audio books make great traveling companions.
        Buy a purse big enough to contain a book. These can protect it from wear and damage.
        Get a notebook and take notes on a book you're currently reading. This can encourage deeper thought and analysis of the book, or help to remember the plot line if you can't read it often.
        Join a book group. This can give you more incentive to finish the book by a certain time. People give you more time to sit and read if you tell them you have to read the book for a book group.
        Read short books. If you are very busy, you're less likely to finish that 600 page  literary epic.
        Read what you love. If you don't like what you are reading and it's not required, read something else. There's no law that says you can't abandon a book just because you don't like it. If you do love a book, you're more likely to return to it and you'll probably finish it faster.
        Read each night before bed or every morning when you get up. Opportunities like these make reading a part of your everyday routine, and they take advantage of times when your mind is most flexible and your life is probably quiet.
        Read in the bathroom. Read in the bathtub (but keep a towel handy so the books don't get wet). If you're no good at keeping books dry in the tub, read a magazine or newspaper instead.
        Read with your spouse or partner, if you have one. It's a great opportunity to spend some quiet time together. You could also read aloud to each other.
        Read in small pieces. If all you have time for is a page or two today, just read that much. It might be enough to get you into the story, or to keep you going until a day when you have more time.
        Learn to read faster, but remember that speed at the expense of understanding gains you nothing. Start by reading at the pace that feels natural to you. You'll naturally speed up with practice.The subject of reading has been much on my mind lately. I love to read but often receive emails from people who struggle to read and struggle to enjoy reading. Thus I thought it might be beneficial to piece together a list of tips to read more and to read better. I hope you find it useful. We start with the obvious: you need to read. Find me someone who has changed the world and who spent his time watching television and I’ll find you a thousand who read books instead. Unless reading is your passion, you may need to be very deliberate about setting aside time to read. You may need to force yourself to do it. Set yourself a reasonable target (“I’m going to read three books this year” or “I’m going to finish this book before the end of the month”) and work towards it. Set aside time every day or every week and make sure you pick up the book during those times. Find a book dealing with a subject of particular interest to you. You may even find it beneficial to find a book that looks interesting—a nice hardback volume with a beautiful cover. Reading is an experience and the experience begins with the look and feel of the book. So find a book that looks like one you’ll enjoy and commit to reading it. And when you’ve done that, find another one and do it again. And again. I’m convinced that one reason people do not read more is that they do not vary their reading enough. Any subject, no matter how much you are interested in it, can begin to feel dry if you focus all of your attention upon it. So be sure to read widely. Read fiction and non-fiction, theology and biography, current affairs and history. You will no doubt want to focus the majority of your reading in one particular area, and that is well and good. But be sure to vary your diet. Similar to reading widely, ensure that you read deliberately. Choose your books carefully. If you neglect to do this, you may find that you overlook a particular category for months or years at a time. Al Mohler, a voracious reader, divides books into six categories: Theology, Biblical Studies, Church Life, History, Cultural Studies, and Literature and has some project going within each of these categories at all times. You can draw up categories of your own, but try to ensure you are reading from all of these categories on a regular basis. Choose books that fit into each of these categories and plan your reading ahead of time, so you know what book you will read next and you know what you’ll read after that. Anticipation for the next book is often a motivating force in completing the current book. Reading is best done, at least when enjoying serious books, when you work hard at understanding the book and when you interact with the author’s arguments. Read with a highlighter and pencil in hand. Ask questions of the author and expect him to answer them through the course of the text. Scrawl notes in the margins, write questions inside the front cover, and return to them often (and, if the questions remain unanswered, even seek to contact the author!). Highlight the most important portions of the book, or the ones you intend to return to later. As Al Mohler says, “Books are to be read and used, not collected and coddled.” I have found that writing reviews of the books I read is a valuable way of returning at least one more time to the book to make sure that I understand what the author was trying to say and how he said it. So interact with those books and make them your own. Though books have incredible power to do good, to challenge and strengthen and edify, they also have the power to do evil. I have seen lives transformed by books but have also seen lives crushed. So do ensure that you read with discernment, always comparing the books you read to the standard of Scripture. If you encounter a book that is particularly controversial, it may be worth ensuring that you can reference a review that interacts critically with the arguments or that you can read it with a person who better understands the arguments and their implications. You do not need to fear bad books as long as you read with a critical eye and with a discerning heart. It can be intimidating to stare at some of those massive volumes or series of volumes sitting on your bookshelf, but be sure to make time to read some of those serious works. A person can only grow so much while living on a diet of Christian Living books. Make your way through some Jonathan Edwards or John Calvin. Read Grudem’s Systematic Theology or David Wells’ “No Place for Truth” series. You will find them slow-going, to be sure, but will also find them rewarding. Commit to reading some of these heavy volumes as a regular part of your reading diet. While dense books should be a serious reader’s main diet, there is nothing wrong with pausing to enjoy the occasional novel or light read. After reading two or three good books, allow yourself to read a Clancy or Grisham or Peretti something else that never changed anyone’s life. Allow yourself to get lost in a good story every now and again. You will find that they refresh you and prepare you to read the next heavy book.</p>
